## Feature Request: Enable Login/Signup with PostgreSQL Database

### Motivation
Currently, the Personal Finance Tracker helps users manage their finances, but secure user authentication and registration (login/signup) are crucial for personal data protection and multi-user support. Integrating a PostgreSQL database will enable robust storage and management of user credentials, allowing for scalable and secure authentication.

### What Needs to Be Done
- Implement a user authentication system (login and signup) that stores user data in a PostgreSQL database.
- Ensure passwords are securely hashed (e.g., using bcrypt or similar libraries).
- Add validation for email/username uniqueness during signup.
- Provide clear error messages for failed logins or registration attempts.
- Update the frontend to connect with the new backend endpoints for authentication.
- Include setup instructions for PostgreSQL (local & deployment) in the README.

### Suggestions for Contributors
- You may use popular libraries/frameworks (e.g., Node.js with Express, Django, Flask, etc.) as suitable for the current tech stack.
- Please structure your code for maintainability (e.g., separate routes/controllers/models).
- If using environment variables for DB credentials, add relevant instructions to the documentation.
- Feel free to suggest improvements or discuss possible approaches in this thread before starting major work.

### Why PostgreSQL?
- Reliable and open-source
- Excellent support for relational data
- Works well with most backend frameworks

**This feature will make the app more secure and allow multiple users to track their finances independently.**
